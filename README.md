# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of analysis
### Analyst was given a large data set of city and ride data. The goal was to find to point out differences based on the different city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. Specifically, values for the total riders, drivers, and fare value of the ride were analyzed.

## Results
### (Please see Resources/df). When analyzing the summary information of the data sample provided, it is clear that, as one would expect, the PyBer activtiy is drastically increases depending on the ctype of city. Urban cities saw a lot more total rides and had a lot more total drives than both Rural and Suburban communities. The cities also generated a lot more total fairs due to their increase in activity. While the gross sum of fares comes from these cities, each ride and driver is more valuable in the rural and urban areas, respectively. The average fair per driver in rural communities is more than triple that of Urban communities and Suburban areas more than double that of Urban communities. The average fare per ride also increases as you move away from the city. One stat that remains fairly constant accross the different city types is the total fare per week (see analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png). We see similar dips and increases on different time frames. 

## Summary
### Recomendation 1: Make this analysis (or a version of it) available to drivers. Avg fair per ride is much higher in rural communities and so is fare per driver. This information should convince some poeple to start giving more rides in these communtites, benefiting both the company and the driver. Recomendation 2: The Urban communities are saturated with drivers. Similar to the previous recomendation, provide incentives to send drivers to areas with less drivers. these undersaturated markets could benefit from some additional drivers.
